# Transcendence Fix Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes and improvements implemented to address the NGINX configuration issues and port constraints for 42 campus deployment.

## 1. NGINX Configuration Restructuring

### Problems Fixed:
- Location blocks outside server blocks causing NGINX to crash
- Poorly structured configuration files
- Missing monitoring endpoints
- No separation of concerns

### Solutions Implemented:
- Restructured main `nginx.conf` to properly include conf.d and snippets
- Created server blocks in separate conf.d files:
  - app.conf: Main application server
  - status.conf: NGINX status and monitoring endpoints
- Created reusable configuration snippets:
  - proxy_common.conf: Common proxy parameters
  - api_proxy.conf: Backend API proxy configuration
  - ws_proxy.conf: WebSocket proxy settings
  - monitoring.conf: Metrics and status endpoints
- Removed problematic configuration files (backed up as .bak)

## 2. Docker Compose Configuration

### Problems Fixed:
- Inconsistent port management
- No profiles for different deployment scenarios
- Services directly exposing ports instead of using NGINX
- Poor monitoring integration

### Solutions Implemented:
- Created a more modular docker-compose.yml
- Implemented Docker Compose profiles:
  - default: Core services
  - prod: Production environment
  - dev: Development environment with direct access
  - monitoring: Monitoring services
  - test: Testing environment
- Bound monitoring services to 127.0.0.1 only (42 campus security)
- Used high-range ports (9100-9500) for 42 campus compatibility
- Improved container healthchecks
- Enhanced service labels for better monitoring

## 3. Environment Configuration

### Problems Fixed:
- Missing centralized port management
- Hard-coded values in multiple files
- No sample configuration for new deployments

### Solutions Implemented:
- Created comprehensive .env.sample file
- Set default port values compliant with 42 campus (9100-9500 range)
- Centralized all port configurations in one file
- Added detailed comments for each configuration value

## 4. Prometheus Monitoring

### Problems Fixed:
- Basic configuration missing important settings
- No alerting rules
- Poor service discovery

### Solutions Implemented:
- Enhanced prometheus.yml with better scrape configurations
- Added service discovery with proper labeling
- Created alerts.yml with predefined alerting rules
- Improved target configurations for all exporters

## 5. Documentation

### Problems Fixed:
- Missing instructions for 42 campus deployment
- Outdated port documentation
- Inconsistent structure

### Solutions Implemented:
- Updated README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- Created detailed ports.md documentation for 42 campus constraints
- Added detailed service configuration documentation
- Documented Docker Compose profiles and their usage

## 6. Deployment Script

### Problems Fixed:
- Manual configuration deployment prone to errors
- Complex setup process

### Solutions Implemented:
- Created apply-fixes.sh script to automate all configuration changes
- Added backup functionality for existing files
- Included clear instructions for usage
- Validated script functionality

## Applied Files

1. **NGINX Configuration**:
   - nginx/nginx.conf
   - nginx/conf.d/app.conf
   - nginx/conf.d/status.conf
   - nginx/snippets/proxy_common.conf
   - nginx/snippets/api_proxy.conf
   - nginx/snippets/ws_proxy.conf
   - nginx/snippets/monitoring.conf

2. **Docker Compose**:
   - compose/docker-compose.yml

3. **Environment**:
   - .env.sample

4. **Prometheus**:
   - monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml
   - monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml

5. **Documentation**:
   - README.md
   - docs/ports.md

6. **Scripts**:
   - scripts/apply-fixes.sh

## Next Steps

1. **Test the configuration**: Verify that NGINX starts without errors
2. **Validate monitoring**: Ensure Prometheus can scrape all targets
3. **Test WebSocket**: Confirm game WebSocket functionality
4. **Review security**: Validate that monitoring services are only accessible from localhost
